we can go back history 

git reset --hard commit_id

before we go back ,what we need to do is know where

git log

if we want back to future,we should know what we have done

git reflog

let's encrept it

ls -ah 

work directory

index(stage) 

repository


git add means add work direcory to index

git commit means commit index to repository

now git status show how to view status of file

git trace commit not file itself

git tracks changes of files

discard work directory that means you discard the changes and the change have not added to stage

git checkout -- index.html

discard stage that means you have added to stage but you still dont want commit repository
git reset HEAD index.html
git checkout -- index.html
  
discard the commit 
git reset --hard commit_id

delete file

case 1: delete the file from repository
delete the file locally
rm -rf test.txt
delete the file from stage
git rm test.txt
add commit to delete from the repository
git commit -m 'delete the file'

case 2: delete the file by mistake
recover the lateset file
git checkout -- test.txt

learn remote repository

step1: crete ssh key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@example.com"

step2: add ssh
copy id_rsa.pub to ssh key

git remote add orign gt@github.com:test/learngit.git
